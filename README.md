# Crawler
Gamejam first-person dungeon crawler, made with Blender Game Engine over the course of a Weekend.

<p>issues:
<br>→ Enemy agression is broken - as in near sensors are probably mixed up, and one Sockpuppet's sensor triggers all the Sockpuppets. It does not always seem to be the same one.
<br>→ The game just exits on victory and restarts on death, some sort of player-feedback would be nice.
